# tidy_data


 Manufacturing data shall be prepared so it can be used in a machine-learning model. As part of the proof-of-concept, your person-of-contact in the plant provides you with about 1h worth of data collected at a small production line.

The data-scientists building the machine-learning model have requested that you provide it to them in the "tidy" format.
